# Birth_Weight_Machine_Learning
Here is the analysis of a dataset as a guideline for: 1) Exploratory Analysis, and, 2) Machine Learning modeling (predicting models)

## Details of the dataset:
Certain factors contribute to the health of a newborn baby. One such health measure is birth weight. Countless studies have identified factors, both preventative and hereditary, that lead to low birth weight. The objective is to analyze and model an infantâ€™s birth weight based on such characteristics.
